This repository is related to the assignment given in the "[コンテンツ入門 (GA13501)](https://kdb.tsukuba.ac.jp/syllabi/2023/GA13501/jpn/)" course at the University of Tsukuba.

My approach to counting the number of tweets, including those with the hashtag ["`#コンテンツ入門2023`"](https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%B3%E3%83%B3%E3%83%86%E3%83%B3%E3%83%84%E5%85%A5%E9%96%802023) that one has posted.
